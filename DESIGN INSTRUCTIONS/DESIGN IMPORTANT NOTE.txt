IMPORTANT NOTE - Description English 

* Figma Design

If you want to see and modify the design, go to your figma page and just 
drag and drop the file, it will be uploaded and you will have it in your 
figma account.

*Favicon

If you want to create your favicon, do it in any design tool
(I recommend figma, it's easier) and export it with the size of 32px.
