IMPORTANT NOTE - Description English 

* Upload project to internet (https://www.netlify.com/)
Follow the steps in the images on how to upload your website to the internet.

* Modify the project

Just add your information in the HTML file and leave the project as it is.

If you are going to modify the project in the CSS file, do it normally.

If you are going to modify the project with the sass files, I recommend watching my video of how to use Sass and my configuration for the projects. If you 
already have knowledge from Sass and has its own settings, you can skip the 
video.

* Images of the project

When inserting different images keep in mind that they must measure the same
size of the original images (eg: 1200 x 1050, etc).
